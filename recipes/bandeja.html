      <h2>Bandeja paisa from Medellin, Colombia.</h2>
      <p>
        The traditional Colombian Bandeja Paisa is less a single recipe and more
        a hearty assembly of several individual components, each prepared
        separately to create a substantial platter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The preparation involves cooking several items concurrently or even the
        day before, starting with slow-simmered red beans often flavored with
        pork belly or hocks and a tomato-onion hogao sauce. Concurrently, plain
        white rice is cooked, and various meats are prepared: ground beef
        (sometimes made into a 'powdered' beef), chorizo sausages, and crispy
        fried pork belly (chicharrón) are all seasoned and cooked until tender
        or golden brown.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Red Beans</li>
        <li>White Rice</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Chicharrón</li>
        <li>Chorizo</li>
        <li>Fried Egg</li>
        <li>Plantain</li>
        <li>Arepa</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the soup:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prepare the beans, hogao and powdered beef one day ahead and keep in
            the refrigerator..
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Get the chicharrón ready:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you are going to serve the bandeja paisa, heat the beans and
            powdered beef and hogao. Make the chicharrones.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make the rice:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Cook the white rice and plantains.</li>
          <li>Fry the eggs and chorizos.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve the bandeja:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To serve, place the rice in a tray or platter and place the rest of
            the ingredients as you like. I prefer the beans in a separate bowl,
            but you can ladle the beans next to the rice if you like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring the hogao in a serving dish to the table, so people can place
            it on top of the beans if they like..
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Get the Aguardiente ready to have an awesome Colombian style lunch.
        </li>
      </ol>
