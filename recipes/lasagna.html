    <h2>The less italian lasagna but also the most delicious one</h2>
    <p>A classic lasagna recipe involves creating a hearty, layered dish from a few key components. The process begins by preparing a rich meat sauce, usually involving browned ground beef (and sometimes sausage), onion, and garlic simmered with crushed tomatoes and Italian seasonings.</p>
    <p>Concurrently, a creamy cheese mixture is made by combining ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses, often bound with an egg and seasoned with fresh parsley or basil. Once the components are ready and the lasagna noodles are either boiled or prepared as "oven-ready", assembly begins in a baking dish with a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking.</p>
