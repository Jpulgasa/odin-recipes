    <h2>Ajiaco from Bogotá, Colombia.</h2>
    <p>Ajiaco is a hearty and comforting traditional Colombian soup, specifically a staple of the capital, Bogotá. The recipe centers around a rich chicken broth and three distinct types of native potatoes—russet, red, and the small, yellow papas criollas—which are essential for the soup's unique consistency and flavor. </p>
    <p>As the soup simmers, the starchy papas criollas and russet potatoes dissolve, naturally thickening the broth to a creamy, luxurious texture while the waxy red potatoes maintain their shape to provide textural contrast. The soup is infused with the key, characteristic flavor of guascas, a local herb (often substituted with a mix of oregano and bay leaf outside Colombia), and includes large pieces of corn on the cob.</p>
